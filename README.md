# m\_tg\_utils

This library is intended for use in my Telegram bots. Reduces boilerplate and thus increases productivity

# What does this library provide?

* A configuration loader
* A `Bot` class that already has a `Dispatcher` (for aiogram)

# What does this library *not* provide?

* Boilerplate generators. These can be found in \<FILL THIS IN LATER; TODO!\>

## Installation

`pip install m_tg_utils`
